# Solr启脚本介绍

Solr includes a script known as "/bin/solr" that allows you to start and stop Solr, create and delete collections or
cores, and check the status of Solr and configured shards. You can find the script in the bin directory of your Solr
installation. The bin/solr script makes Solr easier to work with by providing simple commands and options to quickly
accomplish common goals.
In this section, the headings below correspond to available commands. For each command, the available options
are described with examples.
More examples of bin/solr in use are available throughout the Solr Reference Guide, but particularly in the sections
Running Solr and Getting Started with SolrCloud .
